How to mount the a Root File system in uClinux/Blackfin
-----------------------------------------------------

1	Mounting EXT3 File system.
	------------------------

Creating an EXT3 File system for uClinux/Blackfin
-------------------------------------------------

Please follow the steps to form the Ext3 File system and mount the same as root file system.

a	Make an ext3 file system as large as you want the final root file system.
	
		mkfs.ext3  /dev/ram0 <your-rootfs-size-in-1k-blocks>
	
b	Mount this Empty file system on a free directory as:

		mount -t ext3 /dev/ram0  ./test

c	Copy your root fs directory that you have so carefully made over.

		cp -af  /tmp/my_final_rootfs_files/* ./test

d	If you have done everything right till now you should be able to see the required
	"root" dir's (that's etc, root, bin, lib, sbin...)

e	Now unmount the file system

		umount  ./test

f	Create the root file system image.

		dd if=/dev/ram0 bs=1k count=<your-rootfs-size-in-1k-blocks>  > ext3fs.img

	
Now you have to tell the kernel that will be mounting this file system as rootfs.
So do a make menuconfig under kernel and select the Ext3 journalling file system support 
under File system --> submenu.


2.	Mounting EXT2 File system.
	-------------------------

By default, the ext2 file system image will be created if you invoke make
from the top uClinux-dist directory.

3.	Mounting CRAMFS File System
	----------------------------
To create a CRAMFS file system image execute the command

	mkfs.cramfs ./test cramfs.img

	where ./test is the target directory.


4.	Mounting ROMMFS File System
	--------------------------
To create a ROMFS file system image execute the command

	genromfs -v -V "ROMdisk" -f romfs.img -d ./test
	
	where ./test is the target directory
