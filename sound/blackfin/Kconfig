	help
	  Some blackfin chips appear corrupt data when operated in
	  packed DMA mode.
	  Enabling BROKEN_PACKED_DMA works around this corruption by
	  always using 8 channel DMA to/from the AD1836 chip.  The
	  DMA buffer always contains 8 samples for each frame with
	  inactive channels being zeroed.
