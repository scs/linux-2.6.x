	tristate "MMC/SD for SPI support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
        depends on EXPERIMENTAL && SPI
        default n
        ---help---
	MMC/SD card over SPI support.

	Say Y or M here if you want to attach an MMC/SD socket to the SPI port.
	The "MMC support" option does not need to be enabled for this driver to work.

	Read spi_mmc.txt documentation for details or more help.

config SPI_MMC_CS_CHAN
	int "SPI chip select signal for MMC/SD card"
	depends on SPI_MMC
	range 0 7
	default "4"
	help
	Set the Chip Select signal to use for the MMC/SD card.

config SPI_MMC_CARD_DETECT
	bool "MMC/SD Card detect support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on SPI_MMC && BFIN
	default "n"
	help
	Supported platforms can make use of card detect signal to sense insertion
	and removal of card. Hotplug events could be generated for userspace to
	take action, such as mounting partitions. Debug mode is not available
	with card detection.

config SPI_MMC_CARD_DETECT_PFLAG
	int "Card detect PFx number"
	depends on SPI_MMC_CARD_DETECT
	default "5"
	help
	Which PFx number to use for card detection.

config SPI_MMC_DEBUG_MODE
	bool "Print debug text on errors"
	depends on SPI_MMC && !SPI_MMC_CARD_DETECT
	default n
	---help---
	Will print verobse debug data during MMC/SD errors of any kind. Note that
	during card initialization errors are normal. Also note that a small debug
	log can be found in /proc/spi_mmc entry.
