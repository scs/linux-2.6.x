	  The BF561 processor has two PPI interfaces, PPI0 and PPI1, instead of
	  the single PPI on other Blackfin processors.  By default, PP0 is used.
	  Select this option if you wish to use PPI1 instead.

	  Support for the Micron MT9V032 camera attached to
	  the Blackfin PPI. Although the API is very similar,
	  this driver is not compatible to video4linux but instead
	  implements functionality not provided by video4linux.

	  The SCS Open-Source Camera (OSCAR) framework for leanXcam
	  and derived products depend on this driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called mt9v032.
