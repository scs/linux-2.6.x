config SPI_MMC

	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	help
	  MMC/SD card over SPI support.
	
	  Say Y or M here if you want to attach an MMC/SD socket to the SPI port.
	  The "MMC support" option does not need to be enabled for this driver to work.

	  Note, deselct SPI framework driver and any drivers depending on it to make this
	  driver use the blackfin SPI bus directly in PIO mode.

	  Read spi_mmc.txt documentation for details or more help.

config SPI_MMC_FRAMEWORK_DRIVER
	bool "SPI framework master"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Will use the SPI master of the system. This option is platform indepenent.

config SPI_MMC_BFIN_PIO_SPI
	bool "Blackfin SPI bus directly"
	depends on BFIN
	help
	  Will use Blackfin SPI bus directly. No other SPI device should be used with this option.
	  The MMC/SD card will be driven in SPI PIO mode. This is a failsafe option for testing.

	  Enable SPI framework to use the SPI master instead.

	  NOTE! Using this when SPI framework driver is enabled is not recommended.

config SPI_MMC_CS_CHAN
	int "SPI chip select signal for MMC/SD card"
	depends on SPI_MMC
	range 0 16
	default "4"
	help
	  Set the Chip Select signal to use for the MMC/SD card. This number is one of the
	  SPI master controller SPISEL signals.

config SPI_MMC_MAX_HZ
	int "SPI clock limit for MMC/SD transfers"
	depends on SPI_MMC
	range 400000 30000000
	default "20000000"
	help
	  Maximum clock to aim for when configuring the underlaying SPI device. It may
	  not be possible to set it exactly to this value since the actual clock could
	  depend on an integer division from a reference. Cards seldom support higher
	  clocks than 20Mhz over the SPI bus.

config SPI_MMC_CARD_DETECT
	bool "MMC/SD Card detect support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on SPI_MMC && BFIN
	default "n"
	help
	  MMC/SD card insertion can be detected with a dedicated signal. Configure the IRQ#
	  that is triggered by this signal on falling edge.

config SPI_MMC_CARD_DETECT_INT
	int "IRQ# for card detection"
	depends on SPI_MMC_CARD_DETECT
	default "55"
	help
	  Which IRQ number to use for card detection.

config SPI_MMC_DEBUG_MODE
	bool "Print debug text on errors"
	depends on SPI_MMC && !SPI_MMC_CARD_DETECT
	default n
	help
	  Will print verobse debug data during MMC/SD errors of any kind. Note that
	  during card initialization errors are normal.
